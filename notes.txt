data types are 'int', 'float' , 'double', 'char', 'bool'

Add a .1 before your float in the printf so that it doesnt print the 6 digits after


example of int:
	printf("You are %d years old\n", age ); 
	//there are multiple different values to print %d is decimal, %s is string
	printf("The year is %d\n", year);
	printf("You have ordered %d x items\n", quantity);

example of float:
    //you can only store 6-7 digits after the int in a float
    float gpa = 2.5;
	float price = 19.99;
	float temperature = -10.1;

	printf("Your gpa is %.1f\n", gpa);
	//If you did %.1f it wouldve rouned the .99 up to 1 making it 20 instead of 19.99
	printf("The price is $%.2f\n", price);
	printf("The temperature is %.2f°F\n", temperature);

example of a double:
	//with a double its like a float except you can store 15-16 digits after the number
	double pi = 3.14159265358979;
	double e = 2.7182818284590;

	printf("The value of pi is %.14lf\n", pi);
	printf("The value of e is %.13lf\n", e);
	// '%lf' means long float, which is what a double is, you also have to specify how many numbers
	// after you want to print or it WILL round up, doubles are used for high precision numbers

example of a char:
	//Two things, 1. Char means character. 2. With characters use single quotes
	char grade = 'A';
	char symbol = '!';
	char currency = '$';
	//char's store single characters/symbols
	printf("Your grade is %c\n", grade);
	// %c is the one to call a character
	printf("Your favorite symbol is %c\n", symbol);
	printf("The currency is %c\n", currency);

example of char arrays (strings in C):
	//to store a string in C you need to use a char with an array
	//use double quotes for a array
	char name[] = "Lux/Roman";
	char food[] = "apples";
	char email[] = "fake123@gmail.com";
	
	// Use the format specifier %s for strings
	printf("Hello %s\n", name);
	printf("Your favorite food is %s\n", food);
	printf("Your email is %s\n", email);

example of a bool:
    //if you want to use booleans in C you have to use '#include <stdobool.h>'

    // Bools are binary, True being 1, False being 0
	// Also you can do bool isOnline = 1; for true and isOnline = 0; for false
	bool isOnline = true;
	bool isStudent = false;
	//example of 1. an if statement in C and checking if a boolean is ture or false
	if(isOnline){
		printf("You are ONLINE\n");
	}
	else{
		printf("Youd are OFFLINE\n");
	}

	// If statements automatically checks for specific values depending on the data type of the variable
	// in this case it is a bool meaning itll check for true or false, if it was an int itd be different
	if(isStudent){
		printf("You are a student\n");
	}
	else{
		printf("You are NOT a student\n");
	}
